  about: "With over 3 years of experience, I specialize in crafting end-to-end digital experiences. My journey begins with visual storytelling—designing impactful logos and social media campaigns—and culminates in building scalable, 'weightless' web applications using Antigravity and Gravity UI. I don't just build interfaces; I design systems. Whether it's a high-conversion product design in Adobe Creative Suite or a functional React application in VS Code, my focus is always on turning complex challenges into polished, user-centered realities.",
